        <span class="quote">get a loadout of all of Ruby's abilities, general knowledges, and physical capabilities?</span>
        Ruby has no magical or otherwise extraordinary powers. She has no knowledge of where she is or how she got here, and though she is not a specialist and holds no particularly special knowledge she is reasonably competent with things most people would be.
        Her physical capabilities are varied. She's limber, in good shape, but not particularly strong.<br>
        She is currently carrying:<br>
        CAN-OPENER<br>
        BARE LENGTH OF WIRE<br>
        </p>

        <p class="quote">>chew on wire</p>
        <p>Ruby is above such primitive practices as chewing on wire and cannibalizing her young. If she had any.<br>
        And besides, that would not be productive right now!
