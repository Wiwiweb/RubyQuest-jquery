RubyQuest-jQuery
================

##[Link to the comic (Hosted on GitHub)](http://wiwiweb.github.io/RubyQuest-jquery/)

Re-hosting of the RubyQuest webcomic using jQuery transitions and sounds.

Currently the three ways to read this webcomic are:

* The original archived threads. This is not ideal for those who are not used to navigating those threads, and you also have to go through every post to find the next page.
* The popular flash compilation. In my opinion, flash is a bit overkill just for displaying images and text. It also modified the comic itself in ways the authors didn't particularly like.
* The HTML compilation. This version is very simple, and quite annoying to have to go through pages quickly, reloading every time. It also does not include any of the comments that existed in the original threads.

The goal of this project is to create a new default place for people to link to, to allow newcomers to discover the webcomic. jQuery will allow seamless transition, and even optional music from the [fanmade OST](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4B639222C746AF92).
